## About me
I am a Software Engineer focused on building high-performance, scalable systems. My expertise lies at the intersection of robust architecture and low-level efficiency.

- Deep Dive: I enjoy exploring the internals of software through C++, Rust, and Assembly.

- Architecture: I apply patterns like Hexagonal Architecture to ensure maintainable and decoupled codebases.

- Specialization: Currently mastering the Go ecosystem to build high-concurrency and performant backend solutions.

- Environment: Power user of Linux, automation, and full-stack development.

Turning complex low-level challenges into clean, scalable high-level systems and always looking for a better future.
